# BCI MI Classification
Classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals during the performance a two class Motor Imagery (MI) tasks by different subjects.<br>
In this project we present different methods to handle such problem, using both ML and DL approaches, and test them on data from 2008 BCI competition data set 2b.<br>
The first method relies on feature extraction through Filter Bank Common Spatial Pattern (FBCSP) and classification via Support Vector Machine (SVM).<br>
The second one uses the features extracted with FBCSP and classifies them with the use of a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture.
